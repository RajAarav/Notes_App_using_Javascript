# 📒 Minimal Notes App

A lightweight and clean Notes application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This app allows users to:
- Create multiple notepads
- Automatically start with a blank notepad
- Save notes in **LocalStorage**
- View notes even after refreshing the tab
- Delete any notepad individually

⚡ Changes are saved locally and visible under `Application > LocalStorage` in browser DevTools (while using Live Server in VS Code).

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Minimal user interface
- ✅ Add new notepads
- ✅ Delete existing notepads
- ✅ Start with a blank notepad
- ✅ Persistent storage using browser LocalStorage

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** – structure of the app  
- **CSS** – minimal styling  
- **JavaScript** – app logic and LocalStorage

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- On page load, a blank notepad is created.
- Users can add or delete notes.
- Notes are saved in real-time to LocalStorage.
- Refreshing or reopening the browser shows previously saved notes.
